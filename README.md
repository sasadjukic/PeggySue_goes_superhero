<strong>About</strong><br>
<br>
-PeggySue Goes Superhero(PGS) is a primitive, turn-based text game with quiz elements. The player controls our heroine, PeggySue as she navigates dark fantasy world<br>
-The player's journey depends on our Heroine's speed, energy and the weapon she holds<br>
-Speed determines whether our hero will have more chance to get a turn during battles<br>
-Weapons deal damage if enemy/hero is hit<br>
-Energy, of course is vital for our hero to stay alive<br>
-The player can strengthen the character by picking up weapons, food and "wonder" items like "Monster Energy Drink" <br>
-Food in this game can raise energy up to 100, so if energy is already 100, consuming food has no benefit<br>
-I have included an Easter Egg element to the game that allows player to potentially avoid battling strong enemies in the beginning<br>
-If player fails to answer EE correctly, PeggySue must fight the nemy she encountered<br>
-The Easter Egg questions are related to famous movies, so I guess PGS can challenge your Hollywood film knowledge<br>
-In it's initial form PGS only has one level that can be reached when you defeat three enemies<br>
-Once the level is completed the game terminates<br>

<strong>Known Issues with the game</strong><br>
<br>
-There's an "exploit" that can help our Heroine gain speed by picking up the weakest weapon("Wooden Sword") first before picking up a stronger weapon later in the game<br>
